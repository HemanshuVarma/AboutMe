    <string name="bio">Hello! Hemanshu Varma here from Hyderabad. \n I\'m a Android Developer and
        Tech Enthusiast. \n I graduated from Malla Reddy Institute of Technology and Science
        in Computer Science Specialization. \n I love to code in free hours and cuddle with pooches :P \n
        The best thing about being in Hyderabad is the food and culture followed. :) \n
        The most popular dish is Biryani and people all over India come here just to grab a bite of it.</string>
